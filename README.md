I am a **technologist** and a **computational sciences** student with a passion for leveraging technology to drive societal advancement. Currently pursuing a BSc in Computational Social Science at [University College Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie).

I used to keep my files and projects locally untill I decided to use github again. Turns out git makes productivity levels go brrrr.
