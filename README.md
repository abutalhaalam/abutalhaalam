Hi, Iâ€™m @abutalhaalam,

I am currently learning python (basics have been learnt) and I already have some past experience in frontend website development with html and css (not so much css).

I am planning on making quite a few projects over the next year or so as I learn new things, feel free to reach out to me and collab with me. I need as much as experience I can get where I can learn many new things so every little helps.
